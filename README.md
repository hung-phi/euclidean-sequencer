# Euclidean Step Sequencer
#### Created by Ethan Rountree, Phi Nguyen, Porter Libby
This project was created for Project 1 in CS345 : Software Engineering.
The sequencer is designed to express 1 to 6 voices, each with many configurable options,
including key, octave, wave type, and more. Each voice has a configurable number of
pulses, which will be distributed evenly across the selected number of steps, resulting
in complex polyrhythms and interesting offbeat patterns.

## Install and run
To run the Euclidean Step Sequencer on a local machine:
1. clone it into your directory with ```git clone <url>```
3. from the directory run ```npm install```
4. run ```nodemon index.js``` or ```node index.js```
